# Embedra

**Embedra** is an open-source vector management system built for storing, organizing, and querying embeddings.

### Terminology

- **Collection**: A logical partition within the vector database that isolates and organizes vectors by type or purpose, enabling efficient storage and querying.
- **Files**: Original user-uploaded data assets (PDF, DOCX, images, etc.) that serve as the source for all processing workflows.
- **Document**: Structured text segments extracted and parsed from files, optimized for vectorization and retrieval operations.
- **Embedding**: High-dimensional vectors generated from text or images by AI models, enabling semantic search and similarity matching. While "vector" is the mathematical representation, "embedding" specifically refers to vectors that capture semantic meaning and relationships in the data.
